# Mandatory TODOs

- [ ] Display a prompt when waiting for a new command.
- [ ] Have a working history.
- [ ] Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or
  using a relative or an absolute path).
- [ ] Avoid using more than one global variable to indicate a received signal.
  Consider the implications: this approach ensures that your signal handler will
  not access your main data structures
- [ ] Not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which are not required
  by the subject such as \ (backslash) or ; (semicolon).
- [ ] Handle â€™ (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting
  the meta- characters in the quoted sequence.
- [ ] Handle " (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting
  the meta- characters in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign).
- [ ] Implement redirections:
  - [ ] < should redirect input.
  - [ ] > should redirect output.
  - [ ] << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line
    containing the delimiter is seen. However, it doesnâ€™t have to update the
    history!
  - [ ] >> should redirect output in append mode.
- [ ] Implement pipes (| character). The output of each command in the pipeline
  is connected to the input of the next command via a pipe.
- [ ] Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters)
  which should expand to their values.
- [ ] Handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently
  executed foreground pipeline.
- [ ] Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.
- [ ] In interactive mode:
  - [x] ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
  - [ ] ctrl-D exits the shell.
  - [ ] ctrl-\ does nothing.
- [ ] Your shell must implement the following builtins:
  - [ ] echo with option -n
  - [ ] cd with only a relative or absolute path
  - [ ] pwd with no options
  - [ ] export with no options
  - [ ] unset with no options
  - [ ] env with no options or arguments
  - [ ] exit with no options
- [ ] The readline() function can cause memory leaks. You donâ€™t have to fix
  them. But that doesnâ€™t mean your own code, yes the code you wrote, can have
  memory leaks.

# Logbook

- **[2024-11-14 21:59]** Now i really want to start working on this. A first
  checklist:

  - [x] display the prompt
  - [ ] implement signal handling, 
    - [ ] handle Ctrl-D like bash
    - [x] that is handle Ctrl-C in a correct way

  - **[2024-11-19 01:39]** Well.. the main output of todays.. "coding": there
    are version of bash (on nix bash_interactive) which are build with and
    linked against readline. With those hitting ctrl-d on a non-empty input line
    does nothing. For those bash versions which are not linked against readline
    ctrl-d behaves different. More like explained in the readline-manpage. needs
    some more: ðŸ¤”
