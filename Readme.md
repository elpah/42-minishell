# Roadmap

1) **DONE** Finish Tokenization / Lexing
2) Implement Environment variables
3) Implement HEREDOC functionality
4) Implement Builtins dispatching
4) Implement Parsing of Commands into Command-struct (respecting builtins,
   heredoc and envvars)
5) Implement access-/executability checking
6) Implement execution & error handling **and** return value management in order
   to implement `$?`.

# The Found-An-Error/FIXME-list

- open pipes and redir handling:

      bash-5.2$ asdf asdkjf asdlkj | adsf sd d d d d d|    
      > ^C

      bash-5.2$ asdf asdkjf asdlkj | adsf sd d d d d d >   
      bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
      bash-5.2$ asdf asdkjf asdlkj | adsf sd d d d d d <   
      bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'

  so, after a pipe there should be a prompt waiting for more cmdline input, but
  a redir without words afterwards is an error.

- reproduce this ?!

# Mandatory TODOs

- [x] Display a prompt when waiting for a new command.
  - [ ] make it nicer
- [x] Have a working history.
  - [ ] does it really work correctly in all cases? especially the heredoc case?
  - [ ] Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or
      using a relative or an absolute path).
- [x] Not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which are not required
  by the subject such as \ (backslash) or ; (semicolon).
- [x] Handle â€™ (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting
  the meta- characters in the quoted sequence.
- [x] Handle " (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting
  the meta- characters in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign).
- [ ] Implement redirections:
  - [ ] < should redirect input.
  - [ ] > should redirect output.
  - [ ] 2> should redirect stderr output.
  - [ ] << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line
    containing the delimiter is seen. However, it doesnâ€™t have to update the
    history!
  - [ ] >> should redirect output in append mode.
  - [ ] 2>> should redirect stdout output in append mode.
- [ ] Implement pipes (| character). The output of each command in the pipeline
  is connected to the input of the next command via a pipe.
- [x] Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters)
  which should expand to their values.
- [x] Avoid using more than one global variable to indicate a received signal.
  Consider the implications: this approach ensures that your signal handler will
  not access your main data structures
- [x] Handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently
  executed foreground pipeline.
- [x] Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.
  + [ ] idk know. ctrl-d behaves different for bash's built with lib-readline.
    sometimes ctrl-d on an non-empty prompt is completly ignored sometimes it
    isn't. clarify
- [ ] In interactive mode:
  - [x] ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
  - [x] ctrl-D exits the shell.
    + [ ] clarify different behavior from readline man-page.
  - [x] ctrl-\ does nothing.
- [ ] Your shell must implement the following builtins:
  - [ ] echo with option -n
  - [ ] cd with only a relative or absolute path
  - [ ] pwd with no options
  - [ ] export with no options
  - [ ] unset with no options
  - [ ] env with no options or arguments
  - [ ] exit with no options
- [ ] The readline() function can cause memory leaks. You donâ€™t have to fix
  them. But that doesnâ€™t mean your own code, yes the code you wrote, can have
  memory leaks.

## Parsing / Lexing TODOs

- [x] find a way to make everything obey the norm.
- Tokens to correctly tokenize:
  + [x] command
  + [x] arg
  + [x] pipe
  + [x] "<" redirect in
  + [x] infile
  + [x] ">" redirect out
  + [x] outfile
  + [x] ">>" redirect out append -> outfile stays the same
  + [x] "<<" heredoc -> what? how?
  + [x] heredoc-delimiter
  + [x] "'" single quotes
  + [x] -> single quoted text
  + [x] """ double quotes
  + [x] -> single quoted text (but $variables should be handled)
  + [x] $ variable start
  + [x] -> variable name
  + [x] builtins
  + [x] builtin args for echo, export ("=" + arg), unset, export, cd

# Syntax Notes

Bash syntax errors:

- `cat <` or `cat >` or `cat > |` and the like
- `cat << "<<"` is legit!

# Logbook

- **[2024-11-19 01:39]** Well.. the main output of todays.. "coding": there are
  version of bash (on nix bash_interactive) which are build with and linked
  against readline. With those hitting ctrl-d on a non-empty input line does
  nothing. For those bash versions which are not linked against readline ctrl-d
  behaves different. More like explained in the readline-manpage. needs some
  more: ðŸ¤” ... but not too much. next: parsing!

- **[2024-11-20 12:00]** Some observations relevant for syntax checking /
  parsing:
  + `echo "blabla" | < bindvoutside.log wc -w` is the same as `echo "blabla" |
    wc -w < bindvoutside.log`. so '|' followed by '<' is allowed. The same holds
    for '>'
  + Something like `echo "blabal" | | cat` is not allowed -> *bash: syntax error
    near unexpected token `|'*
  
  So. That said how to parse a prompt like: `< infile cat | wc -w > out`?
  **RULE**: every word after a '<' is considered to be a input_file to cmd.

  + another special case: parsing something like `< a cat | < b wc -w > c`.
    During parsing, after the pipe symbol we would have to allocate a new
    cmdlst-member an then read in redirection first.

- **[2024-11-21 00:12]** Alright parsing of commands, <, >, and | seems to
  working so far. what about >> and << ??? at least << is a very special thing
  as it changes the whole program execution flow.
  Major TODO: somehow make the whole parsing process more elegant and shorter.

- **[2024-11-23 11:24]** I wrote this as a comment to my `get_next_token()`
  yesterday:

  ```c
  /* Get next token from input...
  *
  * This function should return (and increment cl->position accordingly):
  * - the VALUE of the token it found (f.ex. '<', for a word the whole word ->
  *   read until there is some new token)
  * - the position of the token in cmdline
  * 
  * This means the whole classification thing happens in the tokenizing function.
  * Maybe i need to add some flags to the cmdline struct:
  * - for squot / dquot
  * - for var name
  * - for if / of
  * - for heredoc
  * - for pipe
  * - forgot somethin ?!?!
  *
  * then i can really read token-symbol by token-symbol, word by word from the
  * input string using get_next_token(), if it ecounters f.ex. '<' it sets the
  * if_flag inside cmdline-struct, returns to tokenize(), which handles the
  * addition to toklst (and maybe stuff like finding out wether we have a
  * builtin * or not?!?!)
  *
  * Example tokenization-flow: find '<' -> return just "<" -> in tokenize() there
  * is handle_redirect_token(): checks if quot-flags are set, checks if already
  * inside a redirection (actually waiting for the file name), if yes, throw
  * error.... AAAHHHH, maybe this is too much for a tokenizer. This would be the
  * job of my parser!
  *
  * Maybe words should just be TOK_WORD and only during parsing the decision is
  * made that they should be TOK_IF, TOK_CMD, TOK_ARG, ...
  *
  */
  ```
  Today my view on this is as follows. I will have several tokenization and
  parsing steps:

  1) Tokenize very low-level with only as little as possible grammar. I think
     that "as-little" is interpreting quots because in this case all text
     between the quots **will need to be tokenized as-is**, that is with all
     whitespaces and stuff.
  2) My hypothesis: for everything else 1st level of tokenization / parsing can
     happen by simply assigning f.ex. `TOK_RIN` to '<' and `TOK_WORD` to stuff
     like "cat" and "-w".
  3) 2nd level: Iterate over tokenlist. For something like TOK_RIN followed by
     TOK_WORD set token->type of TOK_WORD token to TOK_IF. One very special case
     is the heredoc. If i find this and next toke is TOK_WORD, make it
     TOK_HERE_DLIM (*Error handling ?!?!?!* perhaps in this very step).
  4) 3rd Level: the real parsing starts. Until here couple of errors have been
     ruled out. Time to fill the Command-struct.
  5) maybe 4th Level: Check filenames, permissions etc.
  6) Execution: forks(), run builtins, run heredoc (*TODO: how to implement
     this?!*).

- **[2024-12-05 10:20]** How to streamline the execution process with bltins?
  and possible multi-pipe cmds? How to handle the output redirection / piping of
  a bltin function. Definitely the env-var substitution would have to happen
  beforehand.
  
  Notes on $env-vars:

  - something like `prompt> export LS=ls` and then `prompt> $LS` should execute
    the `ls` cmd.
  - inside quotes text should be substituted
  - BUT if env-vars should also be possibly expanded to cmds, this means the
    expansion *must* happen before cmd parsing!!! F.ex. stuff like 
    `echo "dir" | $LS` should also be possible!

- **[2024-12-06 13:13]** Notes on HEREDOC:
  
  * envvar expansion must happen in HEREDOCs.
  * but envvars should not be intrepreted further!
  * uffz! but there are also multiple HEREDOCs enchained by pipes possible:

        bash-5.2$ cat << eof | cat << miau 
        > asdjf
        > kasdjf
        > eof
        > at
        > miau
        at
        bash-5.2$ 

    it is even worse. this several heredocs problem even exists with one cmd:

        bash-5.2$ cat << eof << moep
        > asdfsdf
        > eof
        > moep
        bash-5.2$ 

    in both cases only the last content is kept. but the heredoc-input is not
    ended before both delimiters have been entered. 
    <center> **HOW to deal with that???** </center>
  * another tricky thing:

        bash-5.2$ cat << eof < moep
        > asdl
        > lsakd
        > eof
        bash: moep: No such file or directory
        bash-5.2$ cat < Makefile << eof
        > alskdf
        > akd
        > eof
        alskdf
        akd
        bash-5.2$

      soooo... the general rule seems to be: the last redirect / heredoc wins.
      So we somehow need a mechanism on deciding which redirect we want to take.
      Furthermore, the heredoc really goes to **STDIN**!!! It is not an
      argument! So, wow.
  * aaaaaaand another one:

        bash-5.2$ cat << eof > bla | cat << miau > blub
        > skdjfasdj
        > akdsjf
        > miau
        > kadsf
        > eof
        > adskfm
        > akjsd
        > miau
        bash-5.2$ cat bla
        skdjfasdj
        akdsjf
        miau
        kadsf
        bash-5.2$ cat blub
        adskfm
        akjsd
        bash-5.2$

      so. yes. all the heredocs need to be associated to their commands, of
      course!! This means, we need to know the cmd structure so that we can
      assign the heredocs to the cmd they belong to.

      the ultimate benchmark:

        bash-5.2$ cat << eof | cat 1>&2 | cat <<miau | cat 1>&2 | cat << moep
        > at
        > eof
        > atat
        > miau
        > atatat
        > moep
        atat
        atatat
        at
        bash-5.2$

      **ARGGGGL!** even this is possible:

        bash-5.2$ cat << eof << miau
        > miau
        > eof
        > miau
        bash-5.2$ cat << eof << miau
        > bla eof
        > eof
        > blau
        > miau
        blau
        bash-5.2$

      -> RULE: even multiple heredocs per cmd are possible AND they are both
      needed to terminate the heredoc-reading BUT only the last reading is
      kept!! this means i really need an array of heredoc-delim strings per cmd
      but only one string for the actual content.


- **[2024-12-07 16:47]** Got the idea for evaluating the heredocs:
  + the heredoc gathering is done for all heredocs at once
  + there can be multiple heredocs per cmd, they also need to be entered at the
    heredoc prompts in FIFO, BUT only the last entry is passed on.
    **SIDENOTE: there can also be multiple redirects, but only the last one is
    used. NOOOOO! See next note... **
  + the execution order seems to be seems to be semi LIFO

- **[2024-12-07 17:19]**
  with a cdmline like this `cat shell.nix > bla > blub` the file `bla` is
  created but empty and the file `blub` has the content of `shell.nix`!
  How should i implement this!? At least this also means, `cmd.output_file` has
  to be a `char **`. And inside `exec_cmd` we need to `open(infile[i], O_CREAT
  ...)` in a loop.

- **[2024-12-07 17:25]**
  What i will implement next step by step:

  - [x] make INT_MAX cmd_args possible, in principle. Therefore count number of
    args in each pipe-seperated tokenlst and take the max of it.
  - [x] make multiple input redirects possible. This only requires being aware
    of that `cmdlst.input_file` might be overridden and therefore should be
    checked `if NULL` otherwise freed before. So this is easy!
  - [ ] make multiple output redirects possible as described above. therefore
    implement `cmdlst.output_file` as `char **`. If we wanted to implement it
    like zsh where `cat shell.nix > bla > blub` really cats the file into both
    files... how could we do it without running the command twice?
  - [ ] heredoc
  - [ ] continue working on the exec problem
  - [ ] how to connect the stdout from builtins to the stdin? Use `dup()`!
  - [ ] Implement `cmd 2>1` or `cmd 2>file` stuff. Certainly needs new tokens.
